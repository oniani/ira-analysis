\begin{abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

\noindent The 2016 Presidential Election was targeted by an unprecedented
intelligence and influence campaign, arising out of Russia, it sought to
undermine the election, sow discord, attack the fissures of the United States
and sway the Election in Donald Trump’s favor. The entirety of the United
States Intelligence infrastructure acknowledge that Russians attempted to sway
the votes of millions of people. Central to this foreign infiltration into the
electorate is the merging machine learning, the principles of misdirection,
online entities deployed for the purposes of deception, and contemporary
research on persuasion, psychology and manipulation. This project not only
seeks to define the underlying dynamic design structures of this influential
campaign, but also to specifically examine how strategic design and targeted
graphic design were generated. From the contemporary political campaign to
advertisement, human actions as sociopolitical agents and consumers can be
intermediated by a contemporary influence practice. It is the contention of
this project that language and image can effectively be interengineered to
produce desired outcomes in audiences through the integrated use of specific
psychological, mnemonic and aesthetic strategies. Historically, these
strategies often use the tools of fear, racism, sexism, othering, white
supremacy and a narrowly focused patriotism. Artificial Intelligence, Content
Analysis and Machine Learning at the End of Democracy, will spend 8 weeks of
this summer using machine learning, to analyze the 3500 Russian Facebook Ad
dataset released by U.S. House of Representa- tives Permanent Select Committee
on Intelligence. We will additionally be examining the 10 million tweets and
2 million image Russian Twitter dataset. These datasets will be used as
“training data” (training data refers to refers to that portion of data used
to fit a model. Unsupervised learning refers to analysis in which one attempts
to learn something about the data. other than predicting an output value of
interest [whether it falls into clusters, for example])*. We will develop our
machine learning software in the Python computer language. We will additionally
be developing software using Google Vision artificial intelligence application
programming interface(set of tools and resources that allows software
developers to create applications) Using machine learning will allow us to
discern patterns in a very large image and text datasets. Specifically an
archive of images that were designed to manipulate the last U.S. Presidential
election. Once we discern patterns our next step is to identify images designed
to foster racism, division and the spread of intolerance.
