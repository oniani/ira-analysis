\begin{abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

\noindent The 2016 United States Presidential Election was targeted by an
unprecedented intelligence and influence campaign. Arising out of Russian
so-called Internet Research Agency (IRA), it sought to sow discord and attack
the fissures of the United States with the ultimate goal of swaying the
election results.~\cite{ira2016}~\cite{ira2016data} Recently, some of the
IRA-backed Facebook advertisements were released by The United States House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. All of the advertisements are in
the PDF format. We have scraped the PDF files and present the results obtained
by textual and statistical analysis of the above-mentioned data. Authorship
attribution and sentiment analysis tests were also performed.~\footnote{Please
note that this paper does not discuss neither social, nor political implications
of these events, but attempts to explore the methods of persuasion that were
employed in this influence campaign.}~\cite{ira2016csvdata} We have also made
the data publicly available for other researchers and/or interested people in
a much nicer and easier-to-manipulate CSV format.

\section*{\centering Data Preparation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Data Preparation}

The data was scraped from~\cite{ira2016data} more than 3500 Russian IRA
Facebook posts made publicly available in the PDF format by the House
Intelligence Committee. We used the free and open-source Python library
~\cite{pdftotext} \texttt{pdftotext} to scrape the data. Many CSV files were
formatted in a way that it was hard for \texttt{pdftotext} to scrape it
correctly. Because of this, we have manually reviewed most of the CSV files
for validity.~\cite{ira2016csvdata} All the CSV files have been made publicly
available.

\section*{\centering General Statistics}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{General Statistics}
The distribution of posts over all three years shows us a bimodal distribution
with two peaks in 2016 Quarter 2 and 2016 Quarter 4. Given the fact that the US
Presidential Election was held in 2016 Quarter 4, it is surprising that the
second quarter had the most of the Facebook ads in it.

\end{figure}

When it comes the money spent on ads, however, the fourth quarter of 2016 is,
by far, the one on which IRA spent the most money on. It is also interesting
that most of of the money was payed in Russian Rubles with two exceptions in
2016 quarter 3 and 2017 quarter 1 where they have spent \$74.000 and \$35.330
respectively. Interestingly, 99.8\% of all paid ads across all years were paid
in Rubles. Below is the chart showing the percentages.

Among the targeted approaches utilized by this campaign, one of the rather
noticeable ones was attacking the fissures of the United States by realizing
both social and political historical backgrounds.

\bigskip

Some of the most common words used in the campaign were black, police, and
people. Below is the barchart showing top 25 most commonly used words after
eliminating linking verbs, prepositions, pronouns, and some other
(non-relevant) words.

\subsubsection*{\centering Common Words}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sentiment Analysis}
For the sentiment analysis purposes, we used \texttt{python}'s \texttt{TextBlob}
library. Suprisingly, out of all Facebook posts with \texttt{Ad Text}, 1643 were
positive, 900 negative, and 933 neutral leaving the overall tone of the posts
positive.

\subsubsection*{\centering Authorship Attribution}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Authorship Attribution}

Since all of these posts were issued by the same political organization/entity,
it was interesting to see if there are some common patterns between the
Facebook ads of 2015, 2016, 2017. For this exact reason, we have performed
authorship attribution tests and have effectively implemented two
state-of-the art paper by Koppel et.~al.
